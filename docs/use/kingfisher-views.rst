Kingfisher Views
================

Read the `Kingfisher Views <https://kingfisher-views.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ documentation, which covers general usage.

See the :doc:`kingfisher-process` page to connect to the server and review log files. The only differences are that log messages are written to ``/var/log/kingfisher-views.log`` and that the topics of log messages are different.

For more information on the topics of log messages, read Kingfisher Views' `logging documentation <https://kingfisher-views.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html>`__.
