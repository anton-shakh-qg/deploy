===========

.. note::

   Is a service unavailable or unreachable? Are web/SSH requests consistently not responding or timing out? Open a ticket in the CRM's `Internal <https://crm.open-contracting.org/projects/ocds/issues?set_filter=1&tracker_id=7>`__ tracker, and send a note to sysadmin@open-contracting.org and sysadmin@dogsbody.com with the web/SSH address that is unavailable.

.. note::

   Is a service producing unexpected errors and interfering with your work? Please open an issue in the relevant `GitHub <https://github.com/open-contracting>`__ repository (or the `deploy <https://github.com/open-contracting/deploy>`__ repository if you don't know). Please follow this `issue template <https://github.com/open-contracting/deploy/issues/new?assignees=jpmckinney&template=critical-service-error.md&title=Critical+service+error>`__.

   If urgent, contact James McKinney via email, Signal, WhatsApp or Google Hangouts. If he is absent, use the CRM to contact:

   -  Centro de Desarrollo Sostenible about Kingfisher Collect and Toucan
   -  Dogsbody Technology Ltd about Redmine CRM and PostgreSQL replica
   -  Datlab about Pelican

   For any gaps in responsibility, open a ticket in the CRM for Lindsey Marchessault to coordinate.
