Kingfisher Process
==================

.. note::

   Is the service unresponsive or erroring? :doc:`Follow these instructions<index>`.

Review log files
----------------

Kingfisher Process writes log messages to the ``/var/log/kingfisher.log`` file. The log file is rotated weekly; last week's log file is at ``/var/log/kingfisher.log.1``, and earlier log files are compressed at ``/var/log/kingfisher.log.2.gz``, etc.

The log files can be read by the ``ocdskfp`` user, after :ref:`connecting to the server<connect-kingfisher-server>`.

Log messages are formatted as:

.. code-block:: none

    [date] [hostname] %(asctime)s - %(process)d - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s

You can filter messages by topic. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    grep NAME /var/log/kingfisher.log | less

For more information, read Kingfisher Process' `logging documentation <https://kingfisher-process.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html>`__.

Load local data
---------------

**Before** using the `local-load command <https://kingfisher-process.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/local-load.html>`__:

#. :ref:`Connect to the main server as the ocdskfp user<connect-kingfisher-server>`

#. Change into the ``local-load`` directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd ~/local-load

#. Create a data directory following the pattern ``source-YYYY-MM-DD-analyst``. For example: ``moldova-2020-04-07-romina``

   -  If the data source is the same as for an `existing spider <https://github.com/open-contracting/kingfisher-collect/tree/main/kingfisher_scrapy/spiders#files>`__, use the same source ID, for example: ``moldova``. Otherwise, use a different source ID that follows our regular pattern ``country[_region][_label]``, for example: ``moldova_covid19``.

#. If you need to download an archive file from a remote URL, prefer ``curl`` to ``wget``, because ``wget`` sometimes writes unwanted files like ``wget-log``.

   -  After unarchiving its contents, you should remove any unnecessary hierarchy from the unarchived files. For example, if all the files are under ``ocds/json``, move the ``json`` directory to the data directory, then remove the ``ocds`` directory.

#. In principle, you should not make changes to the original files. If you need to make changes, put the original and changed files in distinct directories.

#. Load the data, using the `local-load <https://kingfisher-process.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/local-load.html>`__ command.

#. Delete the data directory once you're satisfied that it loaded correctly â€“ and at most 90 days after its creation.

To find directories containing data created more than 90 days ago, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    find -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec bash -c 'if [[ -n $(find {} -ctime +90) ]]; then echo {}; fi' \; | sort
