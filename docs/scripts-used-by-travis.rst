Scripts used by Travis
======================

Some Travis build processes have a deploy component, and sometimes this fetches a script from this repository to run.

For example, `the data standard repository <https://github.com/open-contracting/standard>`_ has
a Travis file that for deployment calls the `deploy-docs.sh` script in this repository.
